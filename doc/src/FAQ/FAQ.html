    <H2 align="center">General Questions</H2>

    <H3 id="item1.1">1.1) What is PostgreSQL? How is it pronounced? What is Postgres?</H3>

    <P>PostgreSQL is pronounced <I>Post-Gres-Q-L</I>.  (For those curious
    about how to say "PostgreSQL", an <a
    href="http://www.postgresql.org/files/postgresql.mp3">audio file</a>
    is available.)</P>

    <P>PostgreSQL is an object-relational database system that has the
    features of traditional commercial database systems with
    enhancements to be found in next-generation <SMALL>DBMS</SMALL>
    systems. PostgreSQL is free and the complete source code is
    available.</P>

    <P>PostgreSQL development is performed by a team of mostly volunteer
    developers spread throughout the world and communicating via the
    Internet. It is a community project and is not controlled by any
    company. To get involved, see the developer's FAQ at <A href=
    "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.FAQ_DEV.html">
    http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.FAQ_DEV.html</A>
    </P>

    <P>Postgres is a widely-used nickname for PostgreSQL.  It was the
    original name of the project at Berkeley and is strongly preferred
    over other nicknames. If you find 'PostgreSQL' hard to pronounce, call
    it 'Postgres' instead.</P>

    <H3 id="item1.2">1.2) Who controls PostgreSQL?<BR></H3>

    <P>If you are looking for a PostgreSQL gatekeeper, central committee,
    or controlling company, give up --- there isn't one.  We do have a
    core committee and CVS committers, but these groups are more for
    administrative purposes than control.  The project is directed by
    the community of developers and users, which anyone can join.  All
    you need to do is subscribe to the mailing lists and participate in the
    discussions.   (See the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.FAQ_DEV.html">
    Developer's FAQ</A> for information on how to get involved in PostgreSQL
    development.)</P>

    <H3 id="item1.3">1.3) What is the copyright of
    PostgreSQL?</H3>

    <P>PostgreSQL is distributed under the classic BSD license.  Basically,
    it allows users to do anything they want with the code, including
    reselling binaries without the source code.  The only restriction is
    that you not hold us legally liable for problems with the software.
    There is also the requirement that this copyright appear in all copies
    of the software.  Here is the actual BSD license we use:</P>

    UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS NO OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE MAINTENANCE,
    SUPPORT, UPDATES, ENHANCEMENTS, OR MODIFICATIONS.</P>

    <H3 id="item1.4">1.4) What platforms does PostgreSQL support?</H3>

    <P>In general, any modern Unix-compatible platform should be able to
    run PostgreSQL. The platforms that had received explicit testing at
    the time of release are listed in the installation
    instructions.</P>

    <P>PostgreSQL also runs natively on Microsoft Windows NT-based operating
    systems like Win2000 SP4, WinXP, and Win2003.  A prepackaged installer is
    available at <a href= "http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pginstaller">
    http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pginstaller</a>.  MSDOS-based versions
    of Windows (Win95, Win98, WinMe) can run PostgreSQL using Cygwin.</P>

    <p>There is also a Novell Netware 6 port at
    <a href="http://forge.novell.com">http://forge.novell.com</a>,
    and an OS/2 (eComStation) version at <a href=
    "http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-search?sh=1&amp;button=Search&amp;key=postgreSQL&amp;stype=all&amp;sort=type&amp;dir=%2F">
    http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-search?sh=1&amp;button=Search&amp;key=postgreSQL&amp;stype=all&amp;sort=type&amp;dir=%2F</a>.</p>

    <H3 id="item1.5">1.5) Where can I get PostgreSQL?</H3>

    <P>Via web browser, use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/">
    http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/</a>, and via ftp, use
    <A href="ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/">
    ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/</A>.</P>

    <H3 id="item1.6">1.6) What is the most recent release?</H3>

    <P>The latest release of PostgreSQL is version 8.3.</P>

    <P>We plan to have a major release every year, with minor releases
    every few months.</P>

    <H3 id="item1.7">1.7) Where can I get support?</H3>

    <P>The PostgreSQL community provides assistance to many of its users
    via email.  The main web site to subscribe to the email lists is
    <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/community/lists/">
    http://www.postgresql.org/community/lists/</a>. The <I>general</I>
    or <I>bugs</I> lists are a good place to start.</P>

    <P>The major IRC channel is <I>#postgresql</I> on Freenode
    (<I>irc.freenode.net</I>).  To connect you can use the Unix
    program <CODE>irc -c '#postgresql' "$USER" irc.freenode.net</CODE>
    or use any other IRC clients.  A Spanish one also exists
    on the same network, (<I>#postgresql-es</I>), a French one,
    (<I>#postgresqlfr</I>), and a Brazilian one, (<I>#postgresql-br</I>).
    There is also a PostgreSQL channel on EFNet.</P>

    <P>A list of commercial support companies is available at <A href=
    "http://www.postgresql.org/support/professional_support">
    http://www.postgresql.org/support/professional_support</A>.</P>

    <H3 id="item1.8">1.8) How do I submit a bug report?</H3>

    <P>Visit the PostgreSQL bug form at <A href=
    "http://www.postgresql.org/support/submitbug">
    http://www.postgresql.org/support/submitbug</A>.
    Also check out our ftp site <A href=
    "ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/">ftp://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/</A> to
    see if there is a more recent PostgreSQL version.</P>

    <P>Bugs submitted using the bug form or posted to any PostgreSQL mailing
    list typically generates one of the following replies:</P>
    <ul>
    <li>It is not a bug, and why</li>
    <li>It is a known bug and is already on the
    <A href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.TODO.html">TODO</A> list</li>
    <li>The bug has been fixed in the current release</li>
    <li>The bug has been fixed but is not packaged yet in an official 
    release</li>
    <li>A request is made for more detailed information:
        <ul>
	<li>Operating system</li>
	<li>PostgreSQL version</li>
	<li>Reproducible test case</li>
	<li>Debugging information</li>
	<li>Debugger backtrace output</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li>The bug is new.  The following might happen:
        <ul>
	<li>A patch is created and will be included in the next major 
	or minor release</li>
	<li>The bug cannot be fixed immediately and is added
	to the <A href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.TODO.html">TODO</A>
        list</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <H3 id="item1.9">1.9) How do I find out about known bugs or
    missing features?</H3>

    <P>PostgreSQL supports an extended subset of <SMALL>SQL:2003</SMALL>.
    See our <A href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.TODO.html">TODO</A>
    list for known bugs, missing features, and future plans.</P>

    <P>A feature request usually results in one of the following
    replies:</P>
    <ul>
    <li>The feature is already on the
    <A href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.TODO.html">TODO</A>
    list</li>
    <li>The feature is not desired because:
        <ul>
        <li>It duplicates existing functionality that already
        follows the SQL standard</li>
        <li>The feature would increase code complexity but add little
        benefit</li>
        <li>The feature would be insecure or unreliable</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The new feature is added to the
    <A href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.TODO.html">TODO</A> list</li>
    </ul>

    <P>PostgreSQL does not use a bug tracking system because we find
    it more efficient to respond directly to email and keep the
    <A href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.TODO.html">TODO</A>
    list up-to-date. In practice, bugs don't last very long in the
    software, and bugs that affect a large number of users are fixed
    rapidly. The only place to find all changes, improvements, and
    fixes in a PostgreSQL release is to read the
    <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/developer/sourcecode/">CVS</a>
    log messages.  Even the release notes do not list every change
    made to the software.</P>

    <H3 id="item1.10">1.10) What documentation is available?</H3>

    <P>PostgreSQL includes extensive documentation, including a large
    manual, manual pages, and some test examples. See the <I>/doc</I>
    directory. You can also browse the manuals online at <A href=
    "http://www.postgresql.org/docs">http://www.postgresql.org/docs</A>.
    </P>

    <P>There are two PostgreSQL books available online at <A href=
    "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/books/awbook.html">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/books/awbook.html</A>
    and <A href=
    "http://www.commandprompt.com/ppbook/">http://www.commandprompt.com/ppbook/</A>.
    There are a number of PostgreSQL books available for purchase.  One
    of the most popular ones is by Korry Douglas.  A list of book reviews
    can be found at <A href=
    "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/books/">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/books/</A>.
    There is also a collection of PostgreSQL technical articles at <A
    href=
    "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/techdocs">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/techdocs</A>.</P>

    <P>The command line client program <I>psql</I> has some \d commands to show
    information about types, operators, functions, aggregates, etc. - use \? to 
    display the available commands.</P>

    <P>Our web site contains even more documentation.</P>

    <H3 id="item1.11">1.11) How can I learn
    <SMALL>SQL</SMALL>?</H3>

    <P>First, consider the PostgreSQL-specific books mentioned above.
    Many of our users also like <I>The Practical SQL Handbook</I>,
    Bowman, Judith S., et al., Addison-Wesley. Others like <I>The
    Complete Reference SQL</I>, Groff et al., McGraw-Hill.</P>

    <H3 id="item1.12">1.12) How do I submit a patch or join the development
    team?</H3>

    <P>See the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/faqs.FAQ_DEV.html">
    Developer's FAQ</A>.</P>

    <H3 id="item1.13">1.13) How does PostgreSQL compare to other
    <SMALL>DBMS</SMALL>s?</H3>

    <P>There are several ways of measuring software: features,
    performance, reliability, support, and price.</P>

    <DL>
      <DT><B>Features</B></DT>

      <DD>PostgreSQL has most features present in large commercial
      <SMALL>DBMS</SMALL>s, like transactions, subselects, triggers,
      views, foreign key referential integrity, and sophisticated
      locking. We have some features they do not have, like
      user-defined types, inheritance, rules, and multi-version
      concurrency control to reduce lock contention.<BR>
      <BR>
      </DD>

      <DT><B>Performance</B></DT>

      <DD>PostgreSQL's performance is comparable to other commercial and
      open source databases. It is faster for some things, slower for
      others.  Our performance is usually +/-10% compared to other databases.
      <BR>
      </DD>

      <DT><B>Reliability</B></DT>

      <DD>We realize that a <SMALL>DBMS</SMALL> must be reliable, or it
      is worthless. We strive to release well-tested, stable code that
      has a minimum of bugs. Each release has at least one month of
      beta testing, and our release history shows that we can provide
      stable, solid releases that are ready for production use. We
      believe we compare favorably to other database software in this
      area.<BR>
      <BR>
      </DD>

      <DT><B>Support</B></DT>

      <DD>Our mailing lists provide contact with a large group of developers
      and users to help resolve any problems encountered. While we cannot
      guarantee a fix, commercial <SMALL>DBMS</SMALL>s do not always
      supply a fix either. Direct access to developers, the user
      community, manuals, and the source code often make PostgreSQL
      support superior to other <SMALL>DBMS</SMALL>s. There is
      commercial per-incident support available for those who need it.
      (See <A href="#item1.7">FAQ section 1.7</A>.)<BR>
      <BR>
      </DD>

      <DT><B>Price</B></DT>

      <DD>We are free for all use, both commercial and non-commercial.
      You can add our code to your product with no limitations, except
      those outlined in our BSD-style license stated above.<BR>
      <BR>
      </DD>
    </DL>

    <H3 id="item1.14">1.14) Will PostgreSQL handle recent daylight
    saving time changes in various countries?</H3>

    <P>USA daylight saving time changes are included in PostgreSQL release
    8.0.[4+], and all later major releases, e.g. 8.1.  Canada and Western
    Australia changes are included in 8.0.[10+], 8.1.[6+], and all later
    major releases.  PostgreSQL releases prior to 8.0 use the operating
    system's timezone database for daylight saving information.</P>

    <HR>

    <H2 align="center">User Client Questions</H2>

    <H3 id="item2.1">2.1) What interfaces are available for
    PostgreSQL?</H3>

    <P>The PostgreSQL install includes only the <SMALL>C</SMALL> and embedded
    <SMALL>C</SMALL> interfaces.  All other interfaces are independent projects
    that are downloaded separately;  being separate allows them to have their
    own release schedule and development teams.</P>

    <P>Some programming languages like <SMALL>PHP</SMALL> include an
    interface to PostgreSQL. Interfaces for languages like Perl,
    <SMALL>TCL</SMALL>, Python, and many others are available at
    <a href="http://pgfoundry.org">http://pgfoundry.org</A>.</P>

    <H3 id="item2.2">2.2) What tools are available for using
    PostgreSQL with Web pages?</H3>

    <P>A nice introduction to Database-backed Web pages can be seen at:
    <A href="http://www.webreview.com">http://www.webreview.com</A></P>

    <P>For Web integration, PHP (<A
    href="http://www.php.net">http://www.php.net</A>) is an excellent
    interface.</P>

    <P>For complex cases, many use the Perl and DBD::Pg with CGI.pm or
    mod_perl.</P>

    <H3 id="item2.3">2.3) Does PostgreSQL have a graphical user
    interface?</H3>

    <P>There are a large number of GUI Tools that are available for PostgreSQL

    <H3 id="item3.1">3.1) How do I install PostgreSQL somewhere
    other than <I>/usr/local/pgsql</I>?</H3>

    <P>Specify the <I>--prefix</I> option when running
    <I>configure</I>.</P>

    <H3 id="item3.2">3.2) How do I control connections from other
    hosts?</H3>

    <P>By default, PostgreSQL only allows connections from the local
    machine using Unix domain sockets or TCP/IP connections. Other
    machines will not be able to connect unless you modify
    <I>listen_addresses</I> in the <I>postgresql.conf</I> file, enable
    host-based authentication by modifying the
    <I>$PGDATA/pg_hba.conf</I> file, and restart the database server.</P>

    <H3 id="item3.3">3.3) How do I tune the database engine for
    better performance?</H3>

    <P>There are three major areas for potential performance
    improvement:</P>

    <DL>
    <DT><B>Query Changes</B></DT>

    <DD>This involves modifying queries to obtain better
    performance:
    <ul>
    <li>Creation of indexes, including expression and partial
    indexes</li>
    <li>Use of COPY instead of multiple <SMALL>INSERT</SMALL>s</li>
    <li>Grouping of multiple statements into a single transaction to
    reduce commit overhead</li>
    <li>Use of <SMALL>CLUSTER</SMALL> when retrieving many rows from an
    index</li>
    <li>Use of <SMALL>LIMIT</SMALL> for returning a subset of a query's
    output</li>
    <li>Use of Prepared queries</li>
    <li>Use of <SMALL>ANALYZE</SMALL> to maintain accurate optimizer
    statistics</li>
    <li>Regular use of <SMALL>VACUUM</SMALL> or <I>pg_autovacuum</I></li>
    <li>Dropping of indexes during large data changes</li>
    </ul><BR>
    <BR>
    </DD>

    <DT><B>Server Configuration</B></DT>

    <DD>A number of <I>postgresql.conf</I> settings affect performance.
    For more details, see <a href=
    "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config.html">
    Administration Guide/Server Run-time Environment/Run-time

    <H3 id="item3.4">3.4) What debugging features are
    available?</H3>

    <P>There are many <CODE>log_*</CODE> server configuration variables
    that enable printing of query and process statistics which can be
    very useful for debugging and performance measurements.</P>

    <H3 id="item3.5">3.5) Why do I get <I>"Sorry, too many
    clients"</I> when trying to connect?</H3>

    <P>You have reached the default limit of 100 database sessions. You
    need to increase the server's limit on how many
    concurrent backend processes it can start by changing the
    <I>max_connections</I> value in <I>postgresql.conf</I> and
    restarting the server.</P>

    <H3 id="item3.6">3.6) What is the upgrade process for PostgreSQL?</H3>

    <P>See <a
    href="http://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning">http://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning</a>
    for a general discussion about upgrading, and <a href=
    "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/install-upgrading.html">
    http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/install-upgrading.html</a>
    for specific instructions.</P>

    <H3 id="item3.7">3.7) What computer hardware should I use?</H3>

    <P>Because PC hardware is mostly compatible, people tend to believe that
    all PC hardware is of equal quality.  It is not.  ECC RAM, SCSI, and
    quality motherboards are more reliable and have better performance than
    less expensive hardware.  PostgreSQL will run on almost any hardware,
    but if reliability and performance are important it is wise to
    research your hardware options thoroughly.  Our email lists can be used
    to discuss hardware options and tradeoffs.</P>

    <H2 align="center">Operational Questions</H2>

    <H3 id="item4.1">4.1) How do I <SMALL>SELECT</SMALL> only the
    first few rows of a query?  A random row?</H3>

    <P>To retrieve only a few rows, if you know at the number of rows
    needed at the time of the <SMALL>SELECT</SMALL> use
    <SMALL>LIMIT</SMALL> . If an index matches the <SMALL>ORDER
    BY</SMALL> it is possible the entire query does not have to be
    executed. If you don't know the number of rows at
    <SMALL>SELECT</SMALL> time, use a cursor and
    <SMALL>FETCH</SMALL>.</P>

    <P>To <SMALL>SELECT</SMALL> a random row, use:</P>
<PRE>
    SELECT col
    FROM tab
    ORDER BY random()
    LIMIT 1;
</PRE>

    <H3 id="item4.2">4.2) How do I find out what tables, indexes,
    databases, and users are defined?  How do I see the queries used
    by <I>psql</I> to display them?</H3>

    <P>Use the \dt command to see tables in <I>psql</I>. For a complete list of
    commands inside psql you can use \?. Alternatively you can read the source 
    code for <I>psql</I> in file <I>pgsql/src/bin/psql/describe.c</I>, it 
    contains <SMALL>SQL</SMALL> commands that generate the output for 
    <I>psql</I>'s backslash commands. You can also start <I>psql</I> with the
    <I>-E</I> option so it will print out the queries it uses to execute the 
    commands you give. PostgreSQL also provides an <SMALL>SQL</SMALL> compliant
    INFORMATION SCHEMA interface you can query to get information about the
    database.</P>

    <P>There are also system tables beginning with <I>pg_</I> that describe
    these too.</P>

    <P>Use <I>psql -l</I> will list all databases.</P>

    <P>Also try the file <I>pgsql/src/tutorial/syscat.source</I>. It
    illustrates many of the <SMALL>SELECT</SMALL>s needed to get
    information from the database system tables.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.3">4.3) How do you change a column's data type?</H3>

    <P>Changing the data type of a column can be done easily in 8.0
    and later with <SMALL>ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN TYPE</SMALL>.</P>

    <P>In earlier releases, do this:</P>
<PRE>
    BEGIN;
    ALTER TABLE tab ADD COLUMN new_col <i>new_data_type</i>;
    UPDATE tab SET new_col = CAST(old_col AS <i>new_data_type</i>);
    ALTER TABLE tab DROP COLUMN old_col;
    COMMIT;
</PRE>
    <P>You might then want to do <I>VACUUM FULL tab</I> to reclaim the
    disk space used by the expired rows.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.4">4.4) What is the maximum size for a row, a
    table, and a database?</H3>

    <P>These are the limits:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD>Maximum size for a database?</TD><TD>unlimited (32 TB databases
exist)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Maximum size for a table?</TD><TD>32 TB</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Maximum size for a row?</TD><TD>400 GB</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Maximum size for a field?</TD><TD>1 GB</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Maximum number of rows in a table?</TD><TD>unlimited</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Maximum number of columns in a table?</TD><TD>250-1600 depending
on column types</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Maximum number of indexes on a
table?</TD><TD>unlimited</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P>Of course, these are not actually unlimited, but limited to
    available disk space and memory/swap space. Performance may suffer
    when these values get unusually large.</P>

    <P>The maximum table size of 32 TB does not require large file
    support from the operating system. Large tables are stored as
    multiple 1 GB files so file system size limits are not
    important.</P>

    <P>The maximum table size, row size, and maximum number of columns
    can be quadrupled by increasing the default block size to 32k.  The
    maximum table size can also be increased using table partitioning.</P>

    <P>One limitation is that indexes can not be created on columns
    longer than about 2,000 characters. Fortunately, such indexes are
    rarely needed. Uniqueness is best guaranteed by a function index
    of an MD5 hash of the long column, and full text indexing
    allows for searching of words within the column.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.5">4.5) How much database disk space is required
    to store data from a typical text file?</H3>

    <P>A PostgreSQL database may require up to five times the disk
    space to store data from a text file.</P>

    <P>As an example, consider a file of 100,000 lines with an integer
    and text description on each line. Suppose the text string
    avergages twenty bytes in length. The flat file would be 2.8 MB.
    The size of the PostgreSQL database file containing this data can
    be estimated as 5.2 MB:</P>
<PRE>
    24 bytes: each row header (approximate)
    24 bytes: one int field and one text field
   + 4 bytes: pointer on page to tuple
   ----------------------------------------
    52 bytes per row

   The data page size in PostgreSQL is 8192 bytes (8 KB), so:

   8192 bytes per page
   -------------------   =  158 rows per database page (rounded down)
     52 bytes per row

   100000 data rows
   --------------------  =  633 database pages (rounded up)
      158 rows per page

633 database pages * 8192 bytes per page  =  5,185,536 bytes (5.2 MB)
</PRE>

    <P>Indexes do not require as much overhead, but do contain the data
    that is being indexed, so they can be large also.</P>

    <P><SMALL>NULL</SMALL>s are stored as bitmaps, so they
    use very little space.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.6">4.6) Why are my queries slow?  Why don't they
    use my indexes?</H3>

    <P>Indexes are not used by every query. Indexes are used only if the
    table is larger than a minimum size, and the query selects only a
    small percentage of the rows in the table. This is because the random
    disk access caused by an index scan can be slower than a straight read
    through the table, or sequential scan. </P>

    <P>To determine if an index should be used, PostgreSQL must have
    statistics about the table. These statistics are collected using
    <SMALL>VACUUM ANALYZE</SMALL>, or simply <SMALL>ANALYZE</SMALL>.
    Using statistics, the optimizer knows how many rows are in the
    table, and can better determine if indexes should be used.
    Statistics are also valuable in determining optimal join order and
    join methods. Statistics collection should be performed
    periodically as the contents of the table change.</P>

    <P>Indexes are normally not used for <SMALL>ORDER BY</SMALL> or to
    perform joins. A sequential scan followed by an explicit sort is
    usually faster than an index scan of a large table.
    However, <SMALL>LIMIT</SMALL> combined with <SMALL>ORDER BY</SMALL>
    often will use an index because only a small portion of the table
    is returned.</P>

    <P>If you believe the optimizer is incorrect in choosing a
    sequential scan, use <CODE>SET enable_seqscan TO 'off'</CODE> and
    run query again to see if an index scan is indeed faster.</P>

    <P>When using wild-card operators such as <SMALL>LIKE</SMALL> or
    <I>~</I>, indexes can only be used in certain circumstances:</P>
    <UL>
    <LI>The beginning of the search string must be anchored to the start
    of the string, i.e.
    <UL>
    <LI><SMALL>LIKE</SMALL> patterns must not start with <I>%</I>.</LI>
    <LI><I>~</I> (regular expression) patterns must start with
    <I>^</I>.</LI>
    </UL></LI>
    <LI>The search string can not start with a character class,
    e.g. [a-e].</LI>
    <LI>Case-insensitive searches such as <SMALL>ILIKE</SMALL> and
    <I>~*</I> do not utilize indexes. Instead, use expression
    indexes, which are described in section <a href="#item4.8">4.8</a>.</LI>
    <LI>The default <I>C</I> locale must be used during
    <i>initdb</i> because it is not possible to know the next-greatest
    character in a non-C locale.  You can create a special
    <CODE>text_pattern_ops</CODE> index for such cases that work only
    for <SMALL>LIKE</SMALL> indexing.  It is also possible to use
    full text indexing for word searches.
    </LI>
    </UL>

    <H3 id="item4.7">4.7) How do I see how the query optimizer is
    evaluating my query?</H3>

    <P>See the <SMALL>EXPLAIN</SMALL> manual page.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.8">4.8) How do I perform regular expression
    searches and case-insensitive regular expression searches? How do I
    use an index for case-insensitive searches?</H3>

    <P>The <I>~</I> operator does regular expression matching, and
    <I>~*</I> does case-insensitive regular expression matching. The
    case-insensitive variant of <SMALL>LIKE</SMALL> is called
    <SMALL>ILIKE</SMALL>.</P>

    <P>Case-insensitive equality comparisons are normally expressed
    as:</P>
<PRE>
    SELECT *
    FROM tab
    WHERE lower(col) = 'abc';
</PRE>
    This will not use an standard index. However, if you create an
    expression index, it will be used: 
<PRE>
    CREATE INDEX tabindex ON tab (lower(col));
</PRE>
    <P>If the above index is created as <SMALL>UNIQUE</SMALL>, though
    the column can store upper and lowercase characters, it can not have
    identical values that differ only in case. To force a particular
    case to be stored in the column, use a <SMALL>CHECK</SMALL>
    constraint or a trigger.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.9">4.9) In a query, how do I detect if a field
    is <SMALL>NULL</SMALL>?  How do I concatenate possible <SMALL>NULL</SMALL>s?
    How can I sort on whether a field is <SMALL> NULL</SMALL> or not?</H3>

    <P>You test the column with <SMALL>IS NULL</SMALL> and <SMALL>IS
    NOT NULL</SMALL>, like this:</P>

<PRE>
   SELECT *
   FROM tab
   WHERE col IS NULL;
</PRE>

   <P>To concatentate with possible <SMALL>NULL</SMALL>s, use <I>COALESCE()</I>,
   like this:</P>
<PRE>
   SELECT COALESCE(col1, '') || COALESCE(col2, '')
   FROM tab
</PRE>

   <P>To sort by the <SMALL>NULL</SMALL> status, use the <SMALL>IS NULL</SMALL>
   and <SMALL>IS NOT NULL</SMALL> modifiers in your <SMALL>ORDER BY</SMALL> clause.
   Things that are <I>true</I> will sort higher than things that are <I>false</I>,
   so the following will put NULL entries at the top of the resulting list:</P>

<PRE>
   SELECT *
   FROM tab
   ORDER BY (col IS NOT NULL)
</PRE>

    <H3 id="item4.10">4.10) What is the difference between the
    various character types?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE>
<TR><TH>Type</TH><TH>Internal Name</TH><TH>Notes</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>VARCHAR(n)</TD><TD>varchar</TD><TD>size specifies maximum
length, no padding</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>CHAR(n)</TD><TD>bpchar</TD><TD>blank padded to the specified
fixed length</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>TEXT</TD><TD>text</TD><TD>no specific upper limit on

<TR><TD>"char"</TD><TD>char</TD><TD>one character</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P>You will see the internal name when examining system catalogs
    and in some error messages.</P>

    <P>The first four types above are "varlena" types (i.e., the first
    four bytes on disk are the length, followed by the data). Thus the
    actual space used is slightly greater than the declared size.
    However, long values are also subject to compression, so the space
    on disk might also be less than expected.</P>

    <SMALL>VARCHAR(n)</SMALL> is best when storing variable-length
    strings and it limits how long a string can be. <SMALL>TEXT</SMALL>
    is for strings of unlimited length, with a maximum of one gigabyte.
    <P><SMALL>CHAR(n)</SMALL> is for storing strings that are all the
    same length. <SMALL>CHAR(n)</SMALL> pads with blanks to the specified
    length, while <SMALL>VARCHAR(n)</SMALL> only stores the characters
    supplied.  <SMALL>BYTEA</SMALL> is for storing binary data,
    particularly values that include <SMALL>NULL</SMALL> bytes. All the
    types described here have similar performance characteristics.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.11.1">4.11.1) How do I create a
    serial/auto-incrementing field?</H3>

    <P>PostgreSQL supports a <SMALL>SERIAL</SMALL> data type. It
    auto-creates a sequence.  For example, this:</P>
<PRE>
    CREATE TABLE person ( 
        id   SERIAL, 
        name TEXT 
    );
</PRE>

    is automatically translated into this: 

<PRE>
    CREATE SEQUENCE person_id_seq;
    CREATE TABLE person ( 
        id   INT4 NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('person_id_seq'),
        name TEXT
    );
</PRE>

    <P>Automatically created sequence are named
    &lt;<I>table</I>&gt;_&lt;<I>serialcolumn</I>&gt;_<I>seq</I>, where
    <I>table</I> and <I>serialcolumn</I> are the names of the table and
    <SMALL>SERIAL</SMALL> column, respectively.  See the
    <I>create_sequence</I> manual page for more information about
    sequences.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.11.2">4.11.2) How do I get the value of a
    <SMALL>SERIAL</SMALL> insert?</H3>

    <P>The simplest way is to retrieve the assigned <SMALL>SERIAL</SMALL>
    value with <SMALL>RETURNING</SMALL>.  Using the example table in <A
    href="#item4.11.1">4.11.1</A>, it would look like this:</P>

<PRE>
    INSERT INTO person (name) VALUES ('Blaise Pascal') RETURNING id;
</PRE>

    You can also call <I>nextval()</I> and use that value in the
    <SMALL>INSERT</SMALL>, or call <I>currval()</I> <I>after</I> the
    <SMALL>INSERT</SMALL>.
    
    <H3 id="item4.11.3">4.11.3) Doesn't <I>currval()</I>
    lead to a race condition with other users?</H3>

    <P>No. <I>currval()</I> returns the current value assigned by your
    session, not by all sessions.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.11.4">4.11.4) Why aren't my sequence numbers
    reused on transaction abort? Why are there gaps in the numbering of
    my sequence/SERIAL column?</H3>

    <P>To improve concurrency, sequence values are given out to running
    transactions as needed and are not locked until the transaction
    completes. This causes gaps in numbering from aborted
    transactions.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.12">4.12) What is an <SMALL>OID</SMALL>? What is
    a <SMALL>CTID</SMALL>?</H3>

    <P>If a table is created <SMALL>WITH OIDS</SMALL>, each row
    gets a unique a <SMALL>OID</SMALL>.  O<SMALL>ID</SMALL>s are
    automatically assigned unique 4-byte integers that are unique
    across the entire installation.  However, they overflow at 4
    billion, and then the O<SMALL>ID</SMALL>s start being duplicated.
    PostgreSQL uses <SMALL>OID</SMALL>s to link its internal system
    tables together.</P>

    <P>To uniquely number rows in user tables, it is best to use
    <SMALL>SERIAL</SMALL> rather than O<SMALL>ID</SMALL>s because
    <SMALL>SERIAL</SMALL> sequences are unique only within a single
    table. and are therefore less likely to overflow.
    <SMALL>SERIAL8</SMALL> is available for storing eight-byte sequence
    values.</P>

    <P>C<SMALL>TID</SMALL>s are used to identify specific physical rows
    with block and offset values. C<SMALL>TID</SMALL>s change after rows
    are modified or reloaded. They are used by index entries to point
    to physical rows.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.13">4.13) Why do I get the error <I>"ERROR:
    Memory exhausted in AllocSetAlloc()"</I>?</H3>

    <P>You probably have run out of virtual memory on your system,
    or your kernel has a low limit for certain resources. Try this
    before starting the server:</P>
<PRE>
    ulimit -d 262144
    limit datasize 256m
</PRE>

    Depending on your shell, only one of these may succeed, but it will
    set your process data segment limit much higher and perhaps allow
    the query to complete. This command applies to the current process,
    and all subprocesses created after the command is run. If you are
    having a problem with the <SMALL>SQL</SMALL> client because the
    backend is returning too much data, try it before starting the
    client.

    <H3 id="item4.14">4.14) How do I tell what PostgreSQL version
    I am running?</H3>

    <P>From <I>psql</I>, type <CODE>SELECT version();</CODE></P>

    <H3 id="item4.15">4.15) How do I create a column that will
    default to the current time?</H3>

    <P>Use <I>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</I>:</P>
<PRE>
    CREATE TABLE test (x int, modtime TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );
</PRE>

    <H3 id="item4.16">4.16) How do I perform an outer join?</H3>

    <P>PostgreSQL supports outer joins using the SQL standard syntax.
    Here are two examples:</P>
<PRE>
    SELECT *
    FROM t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2 ON (t1.col = t2.col);
</PRE>
    or 
<PRE>
    SELECT *
    FROM t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2 USING (col);
</PRE>

    <P>These identical queries join t1.col to t2.col, and also return
    any unjoined rows in t1 (those with no match in t2). A
    <SMALL>RIGHT</SMALL> join would add unjoined rows of t2. A
    <SMALL>FULL</SMALL> join would return the matched rows plus all
    unjoined rows from t1 and t2. The word <SMALL>OUTER</SMALL> is
    optional and is assumed in <SMALL>LEFT</SMALL>,
    <SMALL>RIGHT</SMALL>, and <SMALL>FULL</SMALL> joins. Ordinary joins
    are called <SMALL>INNER</SMALL> joins.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.17">4.17) How do I perform queries using
    multiple databases?</H3>

    <P>There is no way to query a database other than the current one.
    Because PostgreSQL loads database-specific system catalogs, it is
    uncertain how a cross-database query should even behave.</P>

    <P><I>contrib/dblink</I> allows cross-database queries using
    function calls. Of course, a client can also make simultaneous
    connections to different databases and merge the results on the
    client side.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.18">4.18) How do I return multiple rows or
    columns from a function?</H3>

    <P>It is easy using set-returning functions, 
    <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/techdocs.17">
    http://www.postgresql.org/docs/techdocs.17</a>.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.19">4.19) Why do I get "relation with OID #####
    does not exist" errors when accessing temporary tables in PL/PgSQL
    functions?</H3>

    <P>In PostgreSQL versions &lt; 8.3, PL/PgSQL caches function scripts, and
    an unfortunate side effect is that if a PL/PgSQL function accesses a
    temporary table, and that table is later dropped and recreated, and
    the function called again, the function will fail because the cached
    function contents still point to the old temporary table. The solution
    is to use <SMALL>EXECUTE</SMALL> for temporary table access in
    PL/PgSQL. This will cause the query to be reparsed every time.</P>

    <P>This problem does not occur in PostgreSQL 8.3 and later.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.20">4.20) What replication solutions are available?
    </H3>

    <P>Though "replication" is a single term, there are several technologies
    for doing replication, with advantages and disadvantages for each.</P>

    <P>Master/slave replication allows a single master to receive read/write
    queries, while slaves can only accept read/<SMALL>SELECT</SMALL>
    queries. The most popular freely available master-slave PostgreSQL
    replication solution is <A
    href="http://main.slony.info/">
    Slony-I</A>.</P>

    <P>Multi-master replication allows read/write queries to be sent to
    multiple replicated computers.  This capability also has a severe impact
    on performance due to the need to synchronize changes between servers. 
    <A href="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pgcluster/">PGCluster</a> is the
    most popular such solution freely available for PostgreSQL.</P>

    <P>There are also commercial and hardware-based replication solutions
    available supporting a variety of replication models.</P>

    <H3 id="item4.21">4.21) Why are my table and column names not
    recognized in my query?  Why is capitalization not preserved?</H3>

    <P>The most common cause of unrecognized names is the use of
    double-quotes around table or column names during table creation.
    When double-quotes are used, table and column names (called
    identifiers) are stored <a
    href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS">
    case-sensitive</a>, meaning you must use double-quotes when
    referencing the names in a query.  Some interfaces, like pgAdmin,
    automatically double-quote identifiers during table creation.
    So, for identifiers to be recognized, you must either:
    <UL>
    <LI>Avoid double-quoting identifiers when creating tables</LI>
    <LI>Use only lowercase characters in identifiers</LI>
    <LI>Double-quote identifiers when referencing them in queries</LI>
    </UL>
