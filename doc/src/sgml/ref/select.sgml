  <title>Description</title>

  <para>
   <command>SELECT</command> retrieves rows from zero or more tables.
   The general processing of <command>SELECT</command> is as follows:

   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      All elements in the <literal>FROM</literal> list are computed.
      (Each element in the <literal>FROM</literal> list is a real or
      virtual table.)  If more than one element is specified in the
      <literal>FROM</literal> list, they are cross-joined together.
      (See <xref linkend="sql-from" endterm="sql-from-title"> below.)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      If the <literal>WHERE</literal> clause is specified, all rows
      that do not satisfy the condition are eliminated from the
      output.  (See <xref linkend="sql-where"
      endterm="sql-where-title"> below.)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      If the <literal>GROUP BY</literal> clause is specified, the
      output is divided into groups of rows that match on one or more
      values.  If the <literal>HAVING</literal> clause is present, it
      eliminates groups that do not satisfy the given condition.  (See
      <xref linkend="sql-groupby" endterm="sql-groupby-title"> and
      <xref linkend="sql-having" endterm="sql-having-title"> below.)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The actual output rows are computed using the
      <command>SELECT</command> output expressions for each selected
      row.  (See
      <xref linkend="sql-select-list" endterm="sql-select-list-title">
      below.)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Using the operators <literal>UNION</literal>,
      <literal>INTERSECT</literal>, and <literal>EXCEPT</literal>, the
      output of more than one <command>SELECT</command> statement can
      be combined to form a single result set.  The
      <literal>UNION</literal> operator returns all rows that are in
      one or both of the result sets.  The
      <literal>INTERSECT</literal> operator returns all rows that are
      strictly in both result sets.  The <literal>EXCEPT</literal>
      operator returns the rows that are in the first result set but
      not in the second.  In all three cases, duplicate rows are
      eliminated unless <literal>ALL</literal> is specified. (See
      <xref linkend="sql-union" endterm="sql-union-title">, <xref
      linkend="sql-intersect" endterm="sql-intersect-title">, and
      <xref linkend="sql-except" endterm="sql-except-title"> below.)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      If the <literal>ORDER BY</literal> clause is specified, the
      returned rows are sorted in the specified order.  If
      <literal>ORDER BY</literal> is not given, the rows are returned
      in whatever order the system finds fastest to produce.  (See
      <xref linkend="sql-orderby" endterm="sql-orderby-title"> below.)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      <literal>DISTINCT</literal> eliminates duplicate rows from the
      result.  <literal>DISTINCT ON</literal> eliminates rows that
      match on all the specified expressions.  <literal>ALL</literal>
      (the default) will return all candidate rows, including
      duplicates.  (See <xref linkend="sql-distinct"
      endterm="sql-distinct-title"> below.)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      If the <literal>LIMIT</literal> or <literal>OFFSET</literal>
      clause is specified, the <command>SELECT</command> statement
      only returns a subset of the result rows. (See <xref
      linkend="sql-limit" endterm="sql-limit-title"> below.)
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      If <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal> or <literal>FOR SHARE</literal>
      is specified, the
      <command>SELECT</command> statement locks the selected rows
      against concurrent updates.  (See <xref linkend="sql-for-update-share"
      endterm="sql-for-update-share-title"> below.)
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
   You must have <literal>SELECT</literal> privilege on a table to
   read its values.  The use of <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal> or
   <literal>FOR SHARE</literal> requires
   <literal>UPDATE</literal> privilege as well.

  <title>Parameters</title>

  <refsect2 id="SQL-FROM">
   <title id="sql-from-title"><literal>FROM</literal> Clause</title>

   <para>
    The <literal>FROM</literal> clause specifies one or more source
    tables for the <command>SELECT</command>.  If multiple sources are
    specified, the result is the Cartesian product (cross join) of all
    the sources.  But usually qualification conditions
    are added to restrict the returned rows to a small subset of the
    Cartesian product.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <literal>FROM</literal> clause can contain the following
    elements:

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term><replaceable class="parameter">table_name</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table or
        view.  If <literal>ONLY</> is specified, only that table is
        scanned.  If <literal>ONLY</> is not specified, the table and
        all its descendant tables (if any) are scanned.  <literal>*</>
        can be appended to the table name to indicate that descendant
        tables are to be scanned, but in the current version, this is
        the default behavior.  (In releases before 7.1,
        <literal>ONLY</> was the default behavior.)  The default
        behavior can be modified by changing the <xref
        linkend="guc-sql-inheritance"> configuration option.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     
     <varlistentry>
      <term><replaceable class="parameter">alias</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        A substitute name for the <literal>FROM</> item containing the
        alias.  An alias is used for brevity or to eliminate ambiguity
        for self-joins (where the same table is scanned multiple
        times).  When an alias is provided, it completely hides the
        actual name of the table or function; for example given
        <literal>FROM foo AS f</>, the remainder of the
        <command>SELECT</command> must refer to this <literal>FROM</>
        item as <literal>f</> not <literal>foo</>.  If an alias is
        written, a column alias list can also be written to provide
        substitute names for one or more columns of the table.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     
     <varlistentry>
      <term><replaceable class="parameter">select</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        A sub-<command>SELECT</command> can appear in the
        <literal>FROM</literal> clause.  This acts as though its
        output were created as a temporary table for the duration of
        this single <command>SELECT</command> command.  Note that the
        sub-<command>SELECT</command> must be surrounded by
        parentheses, and an alias <emphasis>must</emphasis> be
        provided for it.  A
        <xref linkend="sql-values" endterm="sql-values-title"> command
        can also be used here.
       </para>

     <varlistentry>
      <term><replaceable class="parameter">function_name</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Function calls can appear in the <literal>FROM</literal>
        clause.  (This is especially useful for functions that return
        result sets, but any function can be used.)  This acts as
        though its output were created as a temporary table for the
        duration of this single <command>SELECT</command> command. An
        alias can also be used. If an alias is written, a column alias
        list can also be written to provide substitute names for one
        or more attributes of the function's composite return type. If
        the function has been defined as returning the <type>record</>
        data type, then an alias or the key word <literal>AS</> must
        be present, followed by a column definition list in the form
        <literal>( <replaceable
        class="parameter">column_name</replaceable> <replaceable
        class="parameter">data_type</replaceable> <optional>, ... </>
        )</literal>.  The column definition list must match the actual
        number and types of columns returned by the function.

        </itemizedlist>

        For the <literal>INNER</> and <literal>OUTER</> join types, a
        join condition must be specified, namely exactly one of
        <literal>NATURAL</>, <literal>ON <replaceable
        class="parameter">join_condition</replaceable></literal>, or
        <literal>USING (<replaceable
        class="parameter">join_column</replaceable> [, ...])</literal>.
        See below for the meaning.  For <literal>CROSS JOIN</literal>,
        none of these clauses can appear.
       </para>

       <para>
        A <literal>JOIN</literal> clause combines two
        <literal>FROM</> items.  Use parentheses if necessary to
        determine the order of nesting.  In the absence of parentheses,
        <literal>JOIN</literal>s nest left-to-right.  In any case
        <literal>JOIN</literal> binds more tightly than the commas
        separating <literal>FROM</> items.
       </para>

       <para>
        <literal>CROSS JOIN</> and <literal>INNER JOIN</literal>
        produce a simple Cartesian product, the same result as you get from
        listing the two items at the top level of <literal>FROM</>,
        but restricted by the join condition (if any).
        <literal>CROSS JOIN</> is equivalent to <literal>INNER JOIN ON
        (TRUE)</>, that is, no rows are removed by qualification.
        These join types are just a notational convenience, since they
        do nothing you couldn't do with plain <literal>FROM</> and
        <literal>WHERE</>.
       </para>

       <para>
        <literal>LEFT OUTER JOIN</> returns all rows in the qualified
        Cartesian product (i.e., all combined rows that pass its join
        condition), plus one copy of each row in the left-hand table
        for which there was no right-hand row that passed the join
        condition.  This left-hand row is extended to the full width
        of the joined table by inserting null values for the
        right-hand columns.  Note that only the <literal>JOIN</>
        clause's own condition is considered while deciding which rows
        have matches.  Outer conditions are applied afterwards.
       </para>

       <para>
        Conversely, <literal>RIGHT OUTER JOIN</> returns all the
        joined rows, plus one row for each unmatched right-hand row
        (extended with nulls on the left).  This is just a notational
        convenience, since you could convert it to a <literal>LEFT
        OUTER JOIN</> by switching the left and right inputs.
       </para>

       <para>
        <literal>FULL OUTER JOIN</> returns all the joined rows, plus
        one row for each unmatched left-hand row (extended with nulls
        on the right), plus one row for each unmatched right-hand row
        (extended with nulls on the left).

  <refsect2 id="SQL-WHERE">
   <title id="sql-where-title"><literal>WHERE</literal> Clause</title>

   <para>
    The optional <literal>WHERE</literal> clause has the general form
<synopsis>
WHERE <replaceable class="parameter">condition</replaceable>
</synopsis>
    where <replaceable class="parameter">condition</replaceable> is
    any expression that evaluates to a result of type
    <type>boolean</type>.  Any row that does not satisfy this
    condition will be eliminated from the output.  A row satisfies the
    condition if it returns true when the actual row values are
    substituted for any variable references.
   </para>
  </refsect2>
  
  <refsect2 id="SQL-GROUPBY">
   <title id="sql-groupby-title"><literal>GROUP BY</literal> Clause</title>

   <para>
    The optional <literal>GROUP BY</literal> clause has the general form
<synopsis>
GROUP BY <replaceable class="parameter">expression</replaceable> [, ...]
</synopsis>
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>GROUP BY</literal> will condense into a single row all
    selected rows that share the same values for the grouped
    expressions.  <replaceable
    class="parameter">expression</replaceable> can be an input column
    name, or the name or ordinal number of an output column
    (<command>SELECT</command> list item), or an arbitrary
    expression formed from input-column values.  In case of ambiguity,
    a <literal>GROUP BY</literal> name will be interpreted as an
    input-column name rather than an output column name.
   </para>

   <para>
    Aggregate functions, if any are used, are computed across all rows
    making up each group, producing a separate value for each group
    (whereas without <literal>GROUP BY</literal>, an aggregate
    produces a single value computed across all the selected rows).
    When <literal>GROUP BY</literal> is present, it is not valid for
    the <command>SELECT</command> list expressions to refer to
    ungrouped columns except within aggregate functions, since there
    would be more than one possible value to return for an ungrouped
    column.
   </para>
  </refsect2>

  <refsect2 id="SQL-HAVING">
   <title id="sql-having-title"><literal>HAVING</literal> Clause</title>

   <para>
    The optional <literal>HAVING</literal> clause has the general form
<synopsis>
HAVING <replaceable class="parameter">condition</replaceable>
</synopsis>
    where <replaceable class="parameter">condition</replaceable> is
    the same as specified for the <literal>WHERE</literal> clause.
   </para>
    
   <para>
    <literal>HAVING</literal> eliminates group rows that do not
    satisfy the condition.  <literal>HAVING</literal> is different
    from <literal>WHERE</literal>: <literal>WHERE</literal> filters
    individual rows before the application of <literal>GROUP
    BY</literal>, while <literal>HAVING</literal> filters group rows
    created by <literal>GROUP BY</literal>.  Each column referenced in
    <replaceable class="parameter">condition</replaceable> must
    unambiguously reference a grouping column, unless the reference
    appears within an aggregate function.
   </para>
    
   <para>
    The presence of <literal>HAVING</literal> turns a query into a grouped
    query even if there is no <literal>GROUP BY</> clause.  This is the
    same as what happens when the query contains aggregate functions but
    no <literal>GROUP BY</> clause.  All the selected rows are considered to
    form a single group, and the <command>SELECT</command> list and
    <literal>HAVING</literal> clause can only reference table columns from
    within aggregate functions.  Such a query will emit a single row if the
    <literal>HAVING</literal> condition is true, zero rows if it is not true.
   </para>
  </refsect2>

  <refsect2 id="sql-select-list">
   <title id="sql-select-list-title"><command>SELECT</command> List</title>

   <para>
    The <command>SELECT</command> list (between the key words
    <literal>SELECT</> and <literal>FROM</>) specifies expressions
    that form the output rows of the <command>SELECT</command>
    statement.  The expressions can (and usually do) refer to columns
    computed in the <literal>FROM</> clause.  Using the clause
    <literal>AS <replaceable
    class="parameter">output_name</replaceable></literal>, another
    name can be specified for an output column.  This name is
    primarily used to label the column for display.  It can also be
    used to refer to the column's value in <literal>ORDER BY</> and
    <literal>GROUP BY</> clauses, but not in the <literal>WHERE</> or
    <literal>HAVING</> clauses; there you must write out the
    expression instead.
   </para>

   <para>
    Instead of an expression, <literal>*</literal> can be written in
    the output list as a shorthand for all the columns of the selected
    rows.  Also, one can write <literal><replaceable

    shorthand for the columns coming from just that table.

    The <literal>UNION</literal> clause has this general form:
<synopsis>
<replaceable class="parameter">select_statement</replaceable> UNION [ ALL ] <replaceable class="parameter">select_statement</replaceable>
</synopsis>
    <replaceable class="parameter">select_statement</replaceable> is
    any <command>SELECT</command> statement without an <literal>ORDER

    <literal>FOR SHARE</literal> clause.
    (<literal>ORDER BY</> and <literal>LIMIT</> can be attached to a
    subexpression if it is enclosed in parentheses.  Without
    parentheses, these clauses will be taken to apply to the result of
    the <literal>UNION</literal>, not to its right-hand input
    expression.)
   </para>
    
   <para>
    The <literal>UNION</literal> operator computes the set union of
    the rows returned by the involved <command>SELECT</command>
    statements.  A row is in the set union of two result sets if it
    appears in at least one of the result sets.  The two
    <command>SELECT</command> statements that represent the direct
    operands of the <literal>UNION</literal> must produce the same
    number of columns, and corresponding columns must be of compatible
    data types.
   </para>
    
   <para>
    The result of <literal>UNION</> does not contain any duplicate
    rows unless the <literal>ALL</> option is specified.
    <literal>ALL</> prevents elimination of duplicates.  (Therefore,
    <literal>UNION ALL</> is usually significantly quicker than
    <literal>UNION</>; use <literal>ALL</> when you can.)
   </para>
    
   <para>

  <refsect2 id="SQL-ORDERBY">
   <title id="sql-orderby-title"><literal>ORDER BY</literal> Clause</title>

   <para>
    The optional <literal>ORDER BY</literal> clause has this general form:
<synopsis>
ORDER BY <replaceable class="parameter">expression</replaceable> [ ASC | DESC | USING <replaceable class="parameter">operator</replaceable> ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] [, ...]
</synopsis>
    The <literal>ORDER BY</literal> clause causes the result rows to
    be sorted according to the specified expression(s).  If two rows are
    equal according to the leftmost expression, they are compared
    according to the next expression and so on.  If they are equal
    according to all specified expressions, they are returned in
    an implementation-dependent order.
   </para>

   <para>
    Each <replaceable class="parameter">expression</replaceable> can be the
    name or ordinal number of an output column
    (<command>SELECT</command> list item), or it can be an arbitrary
    expression formed from input-column values.
   </para>

   <para>
    The ordinal number refers to the ordinal (left-to-right) position
    of the result column. This feature makes it possible to define an
    ordering on the basis of a column that does not have a unique
    name.  This is never absolutely necessary because it is always
    possible to assign a name to a result column using the
    <literal>AS</> clause.
   </para>
    
   <para>
    It is also possible to use arbitrary expressions in the
    <literal>ORDER BY</literal> clause, including columns that do not
    appear in the <command>SELECT</command> result list.  Thus the
    following statement is valid:
<programlisting>
SELECT name FROM distributors ORDER BY code;
</programlisting>
    A limitation of this feature is that an <literal>ORDER BY</>
    clause applying to the result of a <literal>UNION</>,
    <literal>INTERSECT</>, or <literal>EXCEPT</> clause can only
    specify an output column name or number, not an expression.
   </para>

   <para>
    If an <literal>ORDER BY</> expression is a simple name that
    matches both a result column name and an input column name,
    <literal>ORDER BY</> will interpret it as the result column name.
    This is the opposite of the choice that <literal>GROUP BY</> will
    make in the same situation.  This inconsistency is made to be
    compatible with the SQL standard.
   </para>
    
   <para>
    Optionally one can add the key word <literal>ASC</> (ascending) or
    <literal>DESC</> (descending) after any expression in the
    <literal>ORDER BY</> clause.  If not specified, <literal>ASC</> is
    assumed by default.  Alternatively, a specific ordering operator
    name can be specified in the <literal>USING</> clause.
    An ordering operator must be a less-than or greater-than
    member of some B-tree operator family.
    <literal>ASC</> is usually equivalent to <literal>USING &lt;</> and
    <literal>DESC</> is usually equivalent to <literal>USING &gt;</>.
    (But the creator of a user-defined data type can define exactly what the
    default sort ordering is, and it might correspond to operators with other
    names.)
   </para>

   <para>
    If <literal>NULLS LAST</> is specified, null values sort after all
    non-null values; if <literal>NULLS FIRST</> is specified, null values
    sort before all non-null values.  If neither is specified, the default
    behavior is <literal>NULLS LAST</> when <literal>ASC</> is specified
    or implied, and <literal>NULLS FIRST</> when <literal>DESC</> is specified
    (thus, the default is to act as though nulls are larger than non-nulls).
    When <literal>USING</> is specified, the default nulls ordering depends
    on whether the operator is a less-than or greater-than operator.
   </para>

   <para>
    Note that ordering options apply only to the expression they follow;
    for example <literal>ORDER BY x, y DESC</> does not mean
    the same thing as <literal>ORDER BY x DESC, y DESC</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Character-string data is sorted according to the locale-specific
    collation order that was established when the database cluster

  </refsect2>

  <refsect2 id="sql-distinct">
   <title id="sql-distinct-title"><literal>DISTINCT</literal> Clause</title>

   <para>
    If <literal>DISTINCT</> is specified, all duplicate rows are
    removed from the result set (one row is kept from each group of
    duplicates).  <literal>ALL</> specifies the opposite: all rows are
    kept; that is the default.
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>DISTINCT ON ( <replaceable
    class="parameter">expression</replaceable> [, ...] )</literal>
    keeps only the first row of each set of rows where the given
    expressions evaluate to equal.  The <literal>DISTINCT ON</literal>
    expressions are interpreted using the same rules as for
    <literal>ORDER BY</> (see above).  Note that the <quote>first
    row</quote> of each set is unpredictable unless <literal>ORDER
    BY</> is used to ensure that the desired row appears first.  For
    example:
<programlisting>
SELECT DISTINCT ON (location) location, time, report
    FROM weather_reports
    ORDER BY location, time DESC;
</programlisting>
    retrieves the most recent weather report for each location.  But
    if we had not used <literal>ORDER BY</> to force descending order
    of time values for each location, we'd have gotten a report from
    an unpredictable time for each location.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <literal>DISTINCT ON</> expression(s) must match the leftmost
    <literal>ORDER BY</> expression(s).  The <literal>ORDER BY</> clause
    will normally contain additional expression(s) that determine the
    desired precedence of rows within each <literal>DISTINCT ON</> group.
   </para>
  </refsect2>
  
  <refsect2 id="SQL-LIMIT">
   <title id="sql-limit-title"><literal>LIMIT</literal> Clause</title>

   <para>
    The <literal>LIMIT</literal> clause consists of two independent
    sub-clauses:
<synopsis>
LIMIT { <replaceable class="parameter">count</replaceable> | ALL }
OFFSET <replaceable class="parameter">start</replaceable>
</synopsis>
    <replaceable class="parameter">count</replaceable> specifies the
    maximum number of rows to return, while <replaceable
    class="parameter">start</replaceable> specifies the number of rows
    to skip before starting to return rows.  When both are specified,
    <replaceable class="parameter">start</replaceable> rows are skipped
    before starting to count the <replaceable
    class="parameter">count</replaceable> rows to be returned.
   </para>

   <para>
    When using <literal>LIMIT</>, it is a good idea to use an
    <literal>ORDER BY</> clause that constrains the result rows into a
    unique order.  Otherwise you will get an unpredictable subset of
    the query's rows &mdash; you might be asking for the tenth through
    twentieth rows, but tenth through twentieth in what ordering?  You
    don't know what ordering unless you specify <literal>ORDER BY</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The query planner takes <literal>LIMIT</> into account when
    generating a query plan, so you are very likely to get different
    plans (yielding different row orders) depending on what you use
    for <literal>LIMIT</> and <literal>OFFSET</>.  Thus, using
    different <literal>LIMIT</>/<literal>OFFSET</> values to select
    different subsets of a query result <emphasis>will give
    inconsistent results</emphasis> unless you enforce a predictable
    result ordering with <literal>ORDER BY</>.  This is not a bug; it
    is an inherent consequence of the fact that SQL does not promise
    to deliver the results of a query in any particular order unless
    <literal>ORDER BY</> is used to constrain the order.
   </para>

   <para>
    It is even possible for repeated executions of the same <literal>LIMIT</>
    query to return different subsets of the rows of a table, if there
    is not an <literal>ORDER BY</> to enforce selection of a deterministic
    subset.  Again, this is not a bug; determinism of the results is
    simply not guaranteed in such a case.

  <refsect2 id="SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE">
   <title id="sql-for-update-share-title"><literal>FOR UPDATE</literal>/<literal>FOR SHARE</literal> Clause</title>

   <para>
    The <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal> clause has this form:
<synopsis>
FOR UPDATE [ OF <replaceable class="parameter">table_name</replaceable> [, ...] ] [ NOWAIT ]
</synopsis>
   </para>

   <para>
    The closely related <literal>FOR SHARE</literal> clause has this form:
<synopsis>
FOR SHARE [ OF <replaceable class="parameter">table_name</replaceable> [, ...] ] [ NOWAIT ]
</synopsis>
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal> causes the rows retrieved by the
    <command>SELECT</command> statement to be locked as though for
    update.  This prevents them from being modified or deleted by
    other transactions until the current transaction ends.  That is,
    other transactions that attempt <command>UPDATE</command>,
    <command>DELETE</command>, or <command>SELECT FOR UPDATE</command>
    of these rows will be blocked until the current transaction ends.
    Also, if an <command>UPDATE</command>, <command>DELETE</command>,
    or <command>SELECT FOR UPDATE</command> from another transaction
    has already locked a selected row or rows, <command>SELECT FOR
    UPDATE</command> will wait for the other transaction to complete,
    and will then lock and return the updated row (or no row, if the
    row was deleted).  For further discussion see <xref
    linkend="mvcc">.
   </para>

   <para>
    To prevent the operation from waiting for other transactions to commit,
    use the <literal>NOWAIT</> option.  <command>SELECT FOR UPDATE
    NOWAIT</command> reports an error, rather than waiting, if a selected row
    cannot be locked immediately.  Note that <literal>NOWAIT</> applies only
    to the row-level lock(s) &mdash; the required <literal>ROW SHARE</literal>
    table-level lock is still taken in the ordinary way (see
    <xref linkend="mvcc">).  You can use the <literal>NOWAIT</> option of
    <xref linkend="sql-lock" endterm="sql-lock-title">
    if you need to acquire the table-level lock without waiting.
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>FOR SHARE</literal> behaves similarly, except that it
    acquires a shared rather than exclusive lock on each retrieved
    row.  A shared lock blocks other transactions from performing
    <command>UPDATE</command>, <command>DELETE</command>, or <command>SELECT
    FOR UPDATE</command> on these rows, but it does not prevent them
    from performing <command>SELECT FOR SHARE</command>.
   </para>

   <para>
    If specific tables are named in <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal>
    or <literal>FOR SHARE</literal>,
    then only rows coming from those tables are locked; any other
    tables used in the <command>SELECT</command> are simply read as
    usual.  A <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal> or <literal>FOR SHARE</literal>
    clause without a table list affects all tables used in the command.
    If <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal> or <literal>FOR SHARE</literal> is
    applied to a view or sub-query, it affects all tables used in
    the view or sub-query.
   </para>

   <para>
    Multiple <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal> and <literal>FOR SHARE</literal>
    clauses can be written if it is necessary to specify different locking
    behavior for different tables.  If the same table is mentioned (or
    implicitly affected) by both <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal> and
    <literal>FOR SHARE</literal> clauses, then it is processed as
    <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal>.  Similarly, a table is processed
    as <literal>NOWAIT</> if that is specified in any of the clauses
    affecting it.
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>FOR UPDATE</literal> and <literal>FOR SHARE</literal> cannot be
    used in contexts where returned rows cannot be clearly identified with
    individual table rows; for example they cannot be used with aggregation.
   </para>

  <caution>
   <para>
    Avoid locking a row and then modifying it within a later savepoint or
    <application>PL/pgSQL</application> exception block.  A subsequent
    rollback would cause the lock to be lost.  For example:
<programlisting>
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE key = 1 FOR UPDATE;
SAVEPOINT s;
UPDATE mytable SET ... WHERE key = 1;
ROLLBACK TO s;
</programlisting>
    After the <command>ROLLBACK</>, the row is effectively unlocked, rather
    than returned to its pre-savepoint state of being locked but not modified.
    This hazard occurs if a row locked in the current transaction is updated
    or deleted, or if a shared lock is upgraded to exclusive: in all these
    cases, the former lock state is forgotten.  If the transaction is then
    rolled back to a state between the original locking command and the
    subsequent change, the row will appear not to be locked at all.  This is
    an implementation deficiency which will be addressed in a future release
    of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.
   </para>
  </caution>

  <caution>
   <para>
    It is possible for a <command>SELECT</> command using both
    <literal>LIMIT</literal> and  <literal>FOR UPDATE/SHARE</literal>
    clauses to return fewer rows than specified by <literal>LIMIT</literal>.
    This is because <literal>LIMIT</> is applied first.  The command
    selects the specified number of rows,
    but might then block trying to obtain lock on one or more of them.
    Once the <literal>SELECT</> unblocks, the row might have been deleted
    or updated so that it does not meet the query <literal>WHERE</> condition
    anymore, in which case it will not be returned.

    compute the results of simple expressions:
<programlisting>
SELECT 2+2;

 ?column?

        4
</programlisting>
    Some other <acronym>SQL</acronym> databases cannot do this except
    by introducing a dummy one-row table from which to do the
    <command>SELECT</command>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Note that if a <literal>FROM</literal> clause is not specified,
    the query cannot reference any database tables. For example, the
    following query is invalid:
<programlisting>
SELECT distributors.* WHERE distributors.name = 'Westward';
</programlisting>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> releases prior to
    8.1 would accept queries of this form, and add an implicit entry
    to the query's <literal>FROM</literal> clause for each table
    referenced by the query. This is no longer the default behavior,
    because it does not comply with the SQL standard, and is
    considered by many to be error-prone. For compatibility with

   <title>The <literal>AS</literal> Key Word</title>

   <para>
    In the SQL standard, the optional key word <literal>AS</> is just

    names.  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> extends each of
    these clauses to allow the other choice as well (but it uses the
    standard's interpretation if there is ambiguity).
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> also allows both clauses to
