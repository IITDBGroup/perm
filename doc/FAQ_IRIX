1.1)	What do I need to install PostgreSQL on IRIX?

PostgreSQL has been reported to run successfully on MIPS r8000, r10000(both
ip25 and ip27) and r12000(ip35) processors, running IRIX 6.5.5m, 6.5.12,
6.5.13, and 6.5.26 with MIPSPro compilers version 7.30, 7.3.1.2m, 7.3, and
7.4.4m.

Aside from the PostgreSQL source distribution, you will need GNU make
(SGI's make will not do), and the MIPSPro full ANSI C compiler.

There are problems trying to build with GCC.  It is a known gcc bug
(not fixed as of version 3.0) related to using functions that return
certain kinds of structures. This bug affects functions like
inet_ntoa, inet_lnaof, inet_netof, inet_makeaddr and semctl.  It is
supposed to be fixed by forcing code to link those functions with
libgcc, but this has not been tested yet.

It is known that version 7.4.1m of the MIPSPro compiler generates
incorrect code.  (Symptom is "invalid primary checkpoint record"
when trying to start the database.)  Version 7.4.4m is OK; the status
of intermediate versions is uncertain.


1.2)	Anything special about the build/install procedure?

There may be a compilation problem like the following:

cc-1020 cc: ERROR File = pqcomm.c, Line = 427
  The identifier "TCP_NODELAY" is undefined.

                if (setsockopt(port->sock, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY,

Some versions include TCP definitions in <sys/xti.h>, so it is necessary to
add #include <sys/xti.h> in src/backend/libpq/pqcomm.c and in
src/interfaces/libpq/fe-connect.c.


1.3)	OK, it seemed to build and install, but the regression test fails.

There are several "expected failures" due to differences between your platform
and the regression test reference platform used by the PostgreSQL group.  All
of these should be compensated for by the regression test comparison
mechanism, with the possible exception of some low-order-digit differences in
the geometry tests (depending on which FPU are you using).

Any other error is cause for suspicion.
