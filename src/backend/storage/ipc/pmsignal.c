 * can be signaled by different backends at the same time.	(However,
 * if the same reason is signaled more than once simultaneously, the
 * postmaster will observe it only once.)

 * portability.  This should ensure that loads and stores of the flag
 * values are atomic, allowing us to dispense with any explicit locking.
