The Postgres Wisconsin Benchmark

The short form of the directions below:

	ensure postmaster is stopped
	export PGDATA=/wherever
	make runtest

The long form:

In this directory are the queries and raw data files used to populate the
Postgres version of the Wisconsin benchmark.  In order to run the benchmark,
you'll initially need to execute the script

./create.sh

which will populate the "bench" database, create the indices, and vacuum the
database.  This will take from 10 minutes or so on a Sparc II/DECstation 5000
class machine to an hour on a Sun 3.

Once create.sh completes, you can execute the benchmark by running the
script

./runwisc.sh

into an output file.  This output file may be quite large (300K or so)
so make sure you have sufficient disk space.  Once the benchmark run has
completed, query execution times can be obtained by running the 

./perquery

script on the output file.  It will generate a nicely formatted, numbered
set of output with times for each query indicated.  (Note that each query
is run twice.)

  !!! WARNING!  DO NOT RUN THESE SCRIPTS IF THE POSTMASTER IS RUNNING !!!
