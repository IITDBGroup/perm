# By convention, we put no more than twenty tests in any one parallel group;
# this limits the number of connections needed to run the tests.
# ----------

# ----------
# The first group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: boolean char name varchar text int2 int4 int8 oid float4 float8 bit numeric txid uuid enum money

# Depends on things setup during char, varchar and text
test: strings
# Depends on int2, int4, int8, float4, float8
test: numerology

# ----------
# The second group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: point lseg box path polygon circle date time timetz timestamp timestamptz interval abstime reltime tinterval inet tstypes comments

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# geometry depends on point, lseg, box, path, polygon and circle
# horology depends on interval, timetz, timestamp, timestamptz, reltime and abstime
# ----------
test: geometry horology oidjoins type_sanity opr_sanity

# ----------
# These four each depend on the previous one
# ----------
test: insert
test: create_function_1
test: create_type
test: create_table
test: create_function_2

# ----------
# Load huge amounts of data
# We should split the data files into single files and then
# execute two copy tests parallel, to check that copy itself
# is concurrent safe.
# ----------
test: copy copyselect

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: constraints triggers create_misc create_aggregate create_operator inherit vacuum drop_if_exists

# Depends on the above
test: create_index create_view

# ----------
# sanity_check does a vacuum, affecting the sort order of SELECT *
# results. So it should not run parallel to other tests.
# ----------
test: sanity_check

# ----------
# Believe it or not, select creates a table, subsequent
# tests need.
# ----------
test: errors
test: select
ignore: random

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: select_into select_distinct select_distinct_on select_implicit select_having subselect union case join aggregates transactions random portals arrays btree_index hash_index update namespace prepared_xacts delete

test: privileges
test: misc

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: select_views portals_p2 rules foreign_key cluster dependency guc combocid tsearch tsdicts

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# ----------
# "plpgsql" cannot run concurrently with "rules", nor can "plancache"
test: plancache limit plpgsql copy2 temp domain rangefuncs prepare without_oid conversion truncate alter_table sequence polymorphism rowtypes returning largeobject xml

# run stats by itself because its delay may be insufficient under heavy load
test: stats

# run tablespace by itself
test: tablespace

# run provenance test
test: provenance
