Installation of PL/pgSQL

1)	Type 'make' to build the shared plpgsql object.

2)	Type 'make install' to install the shared object in
	the PostgreSQL library directory.

3)	Declare the PL/pgSQL procedural language in your
	database by running the createlang script:

		createlang plpgsql DBNAME

	If you declare the language in the template1 database,
	any subsequently created database will have PL/pgSQL
	support installed automatically.
