# This script attempts to find all typedef's in the postgres binaries
# by using 'nm' to report all typedef debugging symbols.
# 
# For this program to work, you must have compiled all binaries with 
# debugging symbols.
#
# This is run on BSD/OS 4.0, so you may need to make changes.
# 
# Ignore the nm errors about a file not being a binary file.
#
# It gets typedefs by reading "STABS":
#
#    http://www.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/doc/texi/stabs_toc.html
#
#    objdump:
#       -G, --stabs  Display (in raw form) any STABS info in the file
#
#       --stabs
#         Display the contents of the .stab, .stab.index, and
#         .stab.excl sections from an ELF file.  This is only
#         useful on systems (such as Solaris  2.0)  in  which
#         .stab debugging symbol-table entries are carried in
#         an ELF section.  In most other file formats, debug-
#         ging  symbol-table  entries  are  interleaved  with
#         linkage symbols, and are visible in the --syms out-
#         put.
